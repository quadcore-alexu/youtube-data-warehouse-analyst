# Data Warehouse for Video Hosting Platforms

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to building a comprehensive data warehouse for storing and analyzing logs from various video hosting platforms, like YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, etc..
The project aims to implement and compare two different approaches: a traditional NoSQL database approach using Scylla and an advanced approach utilizing delta architecture.

## Project Objectives

### Traditional Approach

In the traditional approach, we will leverage a NoSQL database (Scylla) to store raw logs. This approach offers flexibility in handling unstructured data and can efficiently handle the high volume of logs generated by video hosting platforms. However, it may have limitations when it comes to querying and aggregating data for analytical purposes.

### Advanced Approach (Delta Architecture)

The advanced approach will employ delta architecture, combining batch and real-time processing to provide precomputed analytics within the system. This architecture utilizes both a batch layer for storing and processing historical data and a speed layer for handling real-time data, with both layers emerging from bronze tables. The advanced approach aims to enhance query performance and provide near-real-time insights to users.

## Comparisons and Findings

Comparisons and findings are presented in Section 9 (Findings) in the documentation [here](Data_Warehouse_for_Video_Hosting_Platforms.pdf).
