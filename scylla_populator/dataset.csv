i can imagine all the caos all those people that work so hard and not even got mention
🥰🥰🥰🥰
Jobs is inspiring.
"iPhone, that product changed my view of Steve Jobs, from a guy who just stole the fame from Wozniak, and who were just along for the Mac, to a real great product visionary."
Was steve jobs gay or a macho like moi who loves masturbating
It&#39;s not the most influential product of all time.  The model T Ford has a lot bigger impact on day to day life than the iPhone.  The invention of the light bulb was more impactful than the iPhone.  The invention of the internal combustion engine was more impactful than the iPhone.  And the list goes on &amp; on.
"Great documentary.  Captured a really good balance of information, innovation and human impact."
"These people shouldn&#39;t have given up their marriages for a phone. There were plenty of jobs available out there. They all screwed up. I bought the first iPhone for $600 or $700 and they decided en-Mass that it was $100 too much and gave everyone $100 Apple gift cards back as a rebate. Mine ended up falling in my above ground pool when I was filling it and cost me another $300 to get it warrantied.  I have only skipped over the iPhone 6, 8 and 10 phones in the last 16 years.  I have tried new Android phones but they break within a year and are never updated and their is no one to call about problems."
"Btw, anyone know where you can contact Apple if you got an idea for them? Like, for real, legit?"
Bill Burr was right about Steve Jobs.
I had a phone back then with buttons but i never thought of phone without them
"You know, I&#39;ve wondered: Why didn&#39;t anyone create a phone that had a mouse and physical keyboard before the iPhone. Like maybe a physical rolling ball that is the cursor controller, and buttons buttons below cursor controller for clicking, and a scrolling wheel to the right of the phone for scrolling. This way, you could be able to use the internet and stuff. It definatly wouldn&#39;t be as easy to use as the iPhone, but at the time, it would have been a start. Why didn&#39;t anyone think of that before the iPhone? It seems kind of weird to me."
"I mean, was the iPhone THE most influential invention of all times? What about cars, planes, and the lightbulb?"
The thing about this channel… he reports rumors as fact. Don’t believe all of it.
"I was an android user ever since there was android but almost a year ago I switched to iPhone because I was curious about all the hype, I get it now. I’m an Apple fangirl for life now"
After all this innovation you drop your phone on the floor and the screen breaks!...I would not call the apple phone a Revolution?
Those years apple news meant excitement. I remember my first video ipod.
Very cool that jobs had one team competing with another
RIP STEVE JOBS ❤
Kind of funny how Apple never thought their innovation would lead to so much porn lol
"Thumb up for Chien-ming Wang and Taiwan @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24O00Jz8R04&amp;t=0m44s"">0:44</a>"
I had the iPhone 3G 💪
"And Steve got all the credit for the revolutionary iphone, when he&#39;s only the presenter of the product. That&#39;s just sad I feel sorry for the engineers."
This only proves that jobs was a piece of shit.
He stole the Atari ST GEM operating system.
&quot;Today it&#39;s just so easy to forget how much of a revolution the original iPhone was&quot; no - not easy to forget - I am daily amazed by this wonderful and lovely device. I am on 14 now and still in love.
"One would think that all Creative-types at Apple loved Steve Jobs because he endorses art, design, innovation… but “creative differences” are some of the worst and most opinionated contentions alongside forward development.<br><br>Especially when developing privately, in secret, nobody can say, “15% of the representative potential market voted in favor of rectangles, whereas , 45% like circles, 10% like squares, and 30% like rounded squares.”<br><br>Instead, Steve says, “I like the rounded squares, and that’s that. It gets frustrating to have design politics, and you just have to know that’s the way it is.<br><br>In less creative and more scientific endeavors, something that is 15% more efficient and 15% lower in costs wins decisively."
"This is so true to reality: Steve Jobs wanted to kill the “iPhone” project, and did, at one time cease development. But, he also  later supported it.<br><br>The same person who gets credit for green-lighting a project that succeeds also stopped (red-lighted) it multiple times. That’s the schizophrenic nature of people credited for things: they disappointed people, created burnout, etc., altogether known as the “human cost” of new technology."
"Apple probably claimed to invent the mouse (Doug Englebart), desktop metaphor and Ethernet (Xerox Parc). I wish Steve Jobs would say that Apple improved Multi-Touch for introduction into the iPhone, rather than inventing it, but that’s simply not Steve Jobs’ style. Never was."
"Children are using iPhones before they can speak language, reminds me of the mouse."
"To create a new technology, you MUST create a new language (nomenclature). If you’re working on ‘new’ technology platform without a unique and fitting design language, sorry, it’s not new at all, not ‘new’ enough, and probably not revolutionary."
Blackberry (Research in Motion) had an iris-sized trackball on the phones. 🖲️
"iOS was iPhoneOS &amp; iPadOS, until Apple licensed IOS/iOS from Cisco Systems Networking (Internet OS)"
"Unfortunately, the telephone technology is very quiet about the effects of radiation from these “smart phones.“ Studies with conclusions occurred in 1971 warning about the radiation, but Steve Jobs and others ignored the information and did nothing to protect customers. Holding a phone next to your head for 15 minutes is more than likely to be frying your brain literally. At least, use speakerphone as much as possible and keep the phone as far away from your face as you can at all times."
"While the iphone was in it&#39;s very early r&amp;d stages, Steve Jobs said that the smartphone &quot;would only be good for reading something on a toilet&quot;. Truly, a visionary! 🤣"
"One thing missing from this Story is that Jobs was secretly developing the ipad, which was eventually scaled down and became the iphone.  Jobs actually mentioned this a few times...  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24O00Jz8R04&amp;t=26m00s"">26:00</a> - Some knew Jobs had lied and stopped using / buying Apple products."
"First iPhone as a device was mid-average: camera, no multitasking, poor apps, sometimes crashing - it was almost a public prototype.<br>Now as a product, iPhone is a shrewd, bold UX-revolutionary product which paved a way for Apple to pull money out of many pockets.<br><br>Apple has not been very original or groundbreaking in design over the years (and they certainly didn&#39;t &quot;invent&quot; multitouch. Now with M1 and M2 new chapter begins."
"The iPhone did NOT create the modern smart phone.  It is always behind, even the 8525 launched nearly a year before it had more features."
How much of a jerk do you have to be to incorporate someone&#39;s imminent firing into your demonstration by deleting their phone number?
This is the best content in the history of YouTube... haha it shows that we can create innovation case we listen to our guts.
"Kings are all who are remebered, not the soldiers..."
I hate touchscreens and dont like phones either.
Tony Faddell deserved better
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24O00Jz8R04&amp;t=20m45s"">20:45</a> - The on-screen keyboard and predictive text made my life a living hell during my first few years of using a phone without a physical keyboard. Not necessarily related but combined was a not any pleasure for me."
Steve Jobs was a notorious current disavowed paternity of his very own daughter for a decade because he was mad at the mom. Let his daughter live in Barefoot poverty.
You can never control what happens to us.  But we can always control how we react.
The PDA was first.
"Apple is the brand that never creates something, always steals others ideas and call it their own. Built in slave labor camps in China. Turns out Steve wasn’t this genius that we thought he was."
Apple... they exploited people then and are still exploiting people now. That device would cost magnitudes more than it does if it weren&#39;t for labor exploitation in manufacturing. Basically slave and child labor. Changing lives that&#39;s for sure.
It took thousands of hours and countless brilliant minds working to the brink is insanity to launch the first iPhone… and mere nano-seconds for the first d**k pic to be sent… Steve Jobs- we salute you. 🫡
Just shows how dedicated Apple engineers are. They want to change an industry - they WILL change an industry
"A couple of things about this: 1) It was never called iOS to start off with. It was always iPhone OS. The name was only changed with the introduction of iOS 4 - three years after the introduction of the iPhone. 2) Apple didn&#39;t start off designing the iPhone first. It was originally the tablet that was being worked on. Steve even said that the tablet came first and then they shelved it to work on the phone. Once the phone was done, they then started work on the tablet. Aside from that, great documentary."
All that work only to have Samsung come in and steal it.
I appreciate every moment with my iPhone and detest all others.
The iPhone changed the world and my life forever. Life before the iPhone and for me even the Mac seems like a blur at times. This shaped me in a big way made me who I am. My parents worked so hard so I could get these products they payed the way towards my amazing experience that I call life.
I don&#39;t like iPhone I&#39;m not a iPhone user.
Neonode was years prior to apple in creating the smartphone... swipe to unlock and more was more or less stolen.
"&quot;We&#39;ve become totally connected all the time&quot;. The opposite is true: We&#39;ve become totally disconnected, from the world around us. <br>Smartphones = end of humanity"
"I have the Story of the Iphone.   As Bill Burr put it, What the F did that guy ever do?   Told his workers I want my entire music collection on that phone, GET ON IT.   Then comes strolling around the office eating a pretentious fruit like a pear and shouting, I don&#39;t want to hear any thinking going on in there.   With a bunch of his people in the back going, How are we going to do this?  What does this guy think we are Buck Rodgers?"
I read a lot on the toilet!
Thank you for the great information..!
Their first computer sold for $666.66 and there&#39;s a bite taken out of the apple logo.<br>I wonder what that&#39;s supposed to mean and if it has any bearing on the company&#39;s success.<br>The world may never know.
I remember living in Egypt at the time. The first iPhone wasn’t available in our region for a while. I had a friend from the US ship me one. It was locked in with AT&amp;T if I remember correctly. I had to try and figure out how to jailbreak it. I managed to get it done. I was 16 at the time. It was one of the happiest moments of my life. Good times!
"Hmm, it&#39;s not as if there was no iphone there wouldn&#39;t have been smartphones, that&#39;s just nonsense...  people all over the world were working on similar concepts at the same time...  and other companies has products on the market for many years before the iphone...  Apple just did what they did at a good time in the right way...  so business smart...  but in no way revolutionary...<br><br>Glad that this video highlighted where the ideas and contributions for this particular device came from...  but the whole history of handhelds and smartphones is immensely broader and more interesting..."
and then google came along with a way better operating system called android
Apple was good at selecting new inventions among small companies and buy their ideas and put them in their product.
"This was a neat video. Although I was very sad to hear some of the backstory about health and people getting divorced. As a totally blind person, I never thought I’d be able to use a touchscreen in my life. But thanks to voiceover on the iPhone, which came out with the iPhone 3GS. I am now able to use it just like any other person.<br>In fact, when I first saw the iPhone, I still had quite a bit of usable vision. And I remember going over to Blind services to see this new device. And I was thinking to myself, there’s no way in hell this is gonna be usable by people like me. How wrong I was. <br><br>The disabled community uses smart phones just like every other person. In fact, it is level the playing field for us. I can’t live without my iPhone. I use it for work school and play."
"Steve Jobs . . . he unfortunately died, before his time ! 💀"
Rather remarkable that none of this seems even slightly impressive after such a short time. Boom!
"Thank you Ken and all the other unnamed geniuses who REALLY brought us this amazing, truly world-changing technology. I am so thankful every day to live in this time and for all the people whos blood sweat and tears allowed us to truly live in the future"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24O00Jz8R04&amp;t=7m54s"">7:54</a>! look"
A superb discourse! 👍👍
i will never buy an iphone again
Watching this on me 13 PM
Love how every example of &quot;Capitalism working&quot; is just window dressing for some rich dudes buying out a bunch of different ideas
"Steve Jobs was a nobody, 🤓"
RIP Steve Jobs.
"This will sound ridiculous but I told Joy Mountford, head of R&amp;D at Apple, that Apple should make a cordless and eventually a cellular phone in April 1988 or 1989 (whatever year ACM SIGCHI was in Washington DC) at a hospitality suite event Apple held.  I don&#39;t know if she ever told anyone else at Apple.<br><br>I don&#39;t think I said that going touchscreen in the first version was necessary, but just to get into the business starting with the then prevalent cordless phones.  These had obvious linkages to home computers, home theatre, home automation.  The cell phone portability wasn&#39;t feasible then when cell phones were still pretty huge &amp; battery life for handhelds was very short."
"That’s a fancy pantsy shirt if I’ve ever seen one, cheers from Richard in Australia"
This is scary omfgawwwdd
NB: whats the name of the closing song? I know it is closer by Ne yo but what version is this one? its really good
everytime i watch your documentaries I ask myself how you can gather all this information and piece it so neatly and how long it takes you to do a video like this. you are so good at this
"Ooh ooh,the Apple IPhone….pffft…think how many People are Dead because of this Thing…What a Joke"
"If a device like iPhone comes as a product of pain and suffering of many humans, i never want it. Iphone aka smart phone didn&#39;t bring much value to the day to day life as in the cost of human suffering."
Unless micro second day trading was invented by Madoff then he could have made money when the market went up or down similarly just like Bitcoin?  I wrote a similar program for a client in England.
all white people like it always been making significant changes of world rules.<br>but now apple its forced to hire black people due to so called diversity 😂
"Apple locked users out of the device, same Google with android, now... I understand that it is done because of people who don&#39;t know or can make damage to the device but we (root users) have to rely on impossible exploits that cost millions, at least there is someone who cares for iPhone but for android is not this way, oems lock users out of their system and do not allow to unlock bootloader, I&#39;m disappointed honestly, if only Steve would have respected people instead of locking them out maybe now both iPhone and android phones would be like computers on our pocket, but it is not unfortunately"
"Thanks to Steve Jobs we have to fight for right to repair. Thanks to Steve Jobs, Apple booby traps components in their macbooks so you break them more while trying to fix them. Inside of the a2337s and a2179s, Apple made the touch ID cable so thin that it is very very easy to rip. They also glued it down so it rips easier while trying to remove it. Steve Jobs was an asshole. I do own an iPhone, but I can still say that Apple wasnt there first. They just made it better."
Now I know to who blame for the terrible keyboard and terrible auto correct
😁😁😁
"I know this will never happen, but they should make a movie out of this. What a bittersweet story. All of that stress, anxiety, personal tragedy, obsession, and desperation ultimately lead to arguably the most important innovation of the 21st century."
damn video footage from the mid 00&#39;s aged a lot. almost looks like its from the 90s
"cool and informative video, it definitely gives a new perspective on the iPhone origins."
Still a very inspirational story to me.
Can someone tell me the name of the track at the start of the video?
"As a native of San Jose, there is more to  the Bay Area than the Golden Gate Bridge. Cupertino has a very nice view of Mt Umunhum or Loma Prieta."
I recommend a remix regarding the background music. At times it got in the way of what was being said.
I just popped in to point out the total ideocracy of redoing the backbone of a phone every year whether it needs it or not!  It is a Grose taking advantage of a population who agrees to be taken advantage of and needs a new phone every year.  It&#39;s charging what the market will bear in its most fundamental grossness a self-evident truth that you are oppressing them.  It is ridiculous!  And he is a horrid user of humanity.
"Fantastic video , thank you!"
"So the rumor that Steve Jobs came up with the idea for the iPhone while on LSD, isn’t true?, What?"
"First full screen phone wasnt iPhone. Microsoft had Windows CE based PDA made by HP with calling feature., No the first Touchscreen phone was the IBM Simon from 1992"
How did they not end up with a bunch of patents on the touch screen?
This reminds me of some of the greatest movies of all time go through production hell.  Somehow massive turmoil creates amazing products.  To me what made the iPhone the real game changer was the 3G and WiFi  internet connection.  This meant that all the data and computing heavy lifting could be done by servers remotely and then just receive the result quickly.  I find that the Apple Watch especially the Ultra version is a tech masterpiece that people just take for granted.  It is also relatively inexpensive for what it can do.
"He push people to the end, but he did it , but at what cost, and no recognition for others, he was a megalomaniacs."
"Yo this music fucking slaps but like, real soft and nice like."
"My grandfather and father were at the forefront of computer tech being both navy men. Originally my grandfather worked with the punchcards he became a software guy later on. My father worked on the hardware and worked with companies like NCR. He ended his career working for a University so I always had these early products from apples first computer to IBM ect. It was a relatively new tech with pdas and both of them didnt see the appeal. They were old-school computer guys lol! Think about that.... Anyway, I did see the appeal. I had the early pdas as a teen. From cassios Cassiopeia to the early windows ce based products. The ipad touch actually changed the game for me in terms of what that tech could do. I believe the iphone was released first but my carrier didnt really carry them so my first experience was with the ipod touch. Game changer-"
only meritocrisies raise to the top of the natural world.  Those days are gone. We are now in full decline due to a mind virus called wokeology
"I forget how new smart phones really are, it&#39;s like all this technology was invented yesterday"
"Fantastic video, Cold Fusion! However... Unpopular comment: At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24O00Jz8R04&amp;t=25m46s"">25:46</a> this - along with a few other Apple &quot;innovations&quot; - is the reason I have never owned an iPhone or any Apple products. Did I know concretely at the time that Apple stole innovations from others and claimed them as their own? Of course not. Did I feel that one man and one man alone had developed such advanced tech to change the world? Absolutely not. To this day, we still don&#39;t know all the people that were truly involved with the actual development of these technological advancements that&#39;s helped leap us all forward. Hopefully, one day Ill be leaving a different comment, a comment of praise on the documentary revealing the true innovators., @Scorpisces that’s very fair I agree. It also kinda discredits the hundreds of people on the team that worked on the same product to help innovate a product, just by saying Steve Jobs is the innovator of Apple. Thanks for expanding!, “You are a good musician, but I play the orchestra…”, @bgly bico LOL. Perhaps I shoulda been a bit more specific or expanded on my previous comment. The fact that even to this day Steve Jobs is regarded as some sort of Saviour - taking us out of the dark ages, with tech he stole - is what really bothers me., I’m sorry but your logic confuses me, by your logic you wouldn’t  have used a colored tv or lightbulb when they were first introduced? there’s so much technology that has advanced because of people stealing others ideas"
Apple is manufactured in china.<br>I hope the worker class are also taken care of
"This is a great video, but my comment here is broader. I think your series of content is some of the best I’ve seen anywhere on YouTube…. Really classy, well researched, instructive, insightful. Congratulations and many thanks"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24O00Jz8R04&amp;t=8m02s"">8:02</a> 👍👍"
"I think Blackberry had a big hand in development of Apples iPhone....one they wish they hadn&#39;t done! Blackberry mistakenly thought they were untouchable and fell asleep at the wheel., @Gavin Gosbert I loved BBM. Secure end to end. Wish they&#39;d kept their eye on the ball, very true!! remember BBM ? 😅😅"

Brilliant story telling and important lessons to learn regarding corporate culture
"That zoom in discussion is laughable when it&#39;s labeled with the CTRL +/- right there lol. I&#39;d describe it the other way around, back then we had proper ergonomics and now everyone pokes at a touch screen like an ape!"
A big thankyou to all those guys that helped to invent such products
Steve jobs was an incredible inventor tech guy but like alot of wealthy influential people he go way too obsessed with work and success and all the stresses that go along with it i hear he made efforts to become closer with his family near the end
"When I was 22 in 2008, I bought 20k of apple stock and sold it for 50 in 2010 after the worst of the gfc. I would have 3 million today had I just left it alone. 😢, Hey, it was wobbly times for Apple then.  Jobs died and no one was sure if Apple could go on without him."
How about the guy that invented chicken nuggets?
"It&#39;s not surprising that everyone that works at Apple are a-holes that can&#39;t get along with each other. But hey, psychopathy works I guess as Apple is the first company to be valued at over a trillion dollars. But are they happy? So many divorces and Jobs built one of the most beautiful private yachts in the world but never got to truly enjoy it because he refused to accept &quot;western&quot; medicine, AKA medicine, until it was too late. They&#39;re so smart and so dumb."
Thank you ColdFusion for the great videos!
"Steve Jobs didn’t envision the iPhone. The original concept of the iPhone came from an Apple employee walking down Garnett Ave in San Diego asking out loud. “I work for Apple, does anyone have an idea for a phone?” The idea was crowdsourced by an Apple employee from a bouncer who had a customer complain about mobile web and asking “why don’t they have the entire internet on cellphones?” The bouncer told the Apple employee that he had an idea for a phone, “how about a phone with the entire internet on it?” The Apple employee responded “have you seen the screen on cell phones? You never be able to see the internet” he was talking about 2002 phones. The bouncer responded “ Why don’t you just make the entire front of the phone the screen?” Recalling custom card makers he saw in Kmart as a kid. If from the 1980’s to now 2002 we come this far with our technology wouldn’t it be possible to make smaller version of touch screen for the phone. The whole internet on the phone came from an unknown customer complaining about mobile web, the front of the phone being the screen, pinch zoom, a gyro inside that turns the screen came from the bouncer, the iPod inside, location and maps came from the Apple employee. The original idea had a task bar in the UI, admittedly there UI Apple came up with was much better, but the iPhone and iPad ideas didn’t come from anyone at Apple. The iPad was a version of the PDA(personal digital assistant) from the Doom pc game thought up by the bouncer. Apple was supposed to put money into education and propose a thinking class as school curriculum as compensation to the bouncer. That never happened.  This is a true story, I was there in 2002 on Garnett in front of Sinbad Cafe where it happened., Sinbad has bouncers?"
Thank you to Apple and all the engineers at Apple for making the iPhone possible I love the new iPhone SE third generation and also would love to thank Steve Jobs for his Vision on music and computing made it possible to have the iPod 📱 and iPhone 📲
Loved the video
"It’s always a crazy story behind awesomeness. No greater device in the world, than the iPhone. Work, life…period, They&#39;re even demonstrably not the best mobile devices. The UI is excellently designed though, anybody can use them. I repair electronics for a living and iPhones in the last few years show nothing but contempt for their customers. Terrible products nowadays, designed to fail and impossible to open without paying ridiculous amounts to Apple again. They limit your usage of the device if you use 3rd party repair and it takes a laser to get the God damn case apart. Terrible company, they suck."
The remote viewer fairies and leprechauns I swear
Put salt everywhere put some salt on your brain through a necklace
Please IP address they can see through your eyeballs anarchy is what they call it but maybe backwards everybody carry a plastic bottle in your pocket you might have to use it the purpose soul if you don&#39;t have an iPhone
Cassette tape of them somebody stole the whole box of them this has his name on it I&#39;ll haul transfer his dad great dad and his sister&#39;s Ella Bella danger and she hates my guts far fish is it sounds everybody thinks I&#39;m lying but to be honest I&#39;m just that magical
I pil drive them after I thrust back collaborative face and I&#39;ve destroyed his brain at a self-defense because I told him I did not want to fight on purpose to get my respect back cuz he was out of pocket
I have a witness that saw the fight and when I walked around the block they said it was such a loud noise it was like a car crash or a bus
One guy was told me to mind my business and the witnesses were two of them are elevated and lit up a ball fire

This honorable demons said they&#39;re going to take their time and serve a thousand years next we get the bungee jump without a bungee mass suicide everywhere they&#39;re going to take the ones that they can still take the ones who sold their soul on purpose if they got it back they got it back but they don&#39;t they&#39;re readiness they&#39;re downfall everybody also got trick it&#39;s off the hook.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24O00Jz8R04&amp;t=28m04s"">28:04</a> So did you invest in Apple?"
hands down some of the best content on youtube
To this day you can’t zoom in on EVERYTHING 🤷‍♂️
"The more i watch these videos, the more I realise that Jobs was a good product dev, but by no means was the genius he&#39;s made out to be. So many people who i don&#39;t know came up with such incredible ideas, @SpreadAttackU18 what is &quot;potus,&quot; some kind of bacterial infection...?, @Jon North at best he had a good eye for design. In terms of invention he did nothing., He never invented anything. Just a good salesboy., He was the face, like POTUS, Just a point… “genius” is 100% linked to creativity and innovation and therefore product development. Genius is not typically a word one would associate with Management or People Development, leadership etc. Therefore that title is not really out of place."
Steve Jobs was such an unbelievable asshole lol
"So, Ken is the who’s responsible for the phenomenon that plagued the humanity called Autocucumber!!!!"
all other phone companies should be thankful to apple otherwise we would still use god knows what...
Do you think Jobs sabotaged the Motorola Rocker to go back to Apple and improve the Apple I-Pod? Well he ...
"I hate that there is only touchscreens now, slide out keyboard like on nokia n900 was the best. I hate autocorrect, it just &quot;corrects&quot; to something wrong so i always keep it off. It makes sense on number keyboards older phones had, there it was actually helpful cos then you dont have to press keys multiple times for each letter."
The iPhone... ithe reason I ditched Nokia and the Symbian OS in 2013 for... Samsung and the Android OS. The iPhone was a food product but way off my budget.
"The fact that I&#39;m sitting here watching this video on a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra,  makes me realize how grateful we need to be to all those engineers who gave up so much to create such a revolutionary product such as the iPhone...without the iPhone it&#39;s very possible all of the current touchscreen phones we enjoy today probably wouldn&#39;t exist...Thank you Apple and all those great engineers who gave up so much time and made so many sacrifices and Steve wherever you are thank you for being such a visionary and leading such a great team!💪, Yeah we probably wouldn&#39;t have superior devices like the S22 ultra (same phone I have) if not for the groundwork with apps and such. It&#39;s crazy how android caught up and even surpassed the ios system, A 4s is useless today. I&#39;m sure the person who&#39;se phone was stolen, thinks otherwise."
"<b>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I came here to learn how to trade after listening to a guy on radio talk about the importance of investing and how he made $460,000 in 4 months from $160k.

She has since provided entry and exit points on the securities I focus on.

Amazing video. Watched it on my iphone 14
"Where did Steve Jobs get the idea of iPhone? I mean the original idea. It was from me (uphone). He did a great job to put things together for a commercial success., Did you not watch the video"
"In hindsight it’s crazy to think about the fact that for a device that was dismissed at first, and almost didn’t happen, has become apples main thing as a source of revenue. iPhones account for half of apples annual revenue. If iPhones fell off it could very realistically end apple with how dependent it is on its sales."
"One of the wild things about the original iPhone for me, in hindsight, is how the first model ran on Edge networks. I find that interesting because Edge as a network is so slow when it comes to the internet that I can’t imagine that the phones internet capabilities on the original model were all that great. They probably seemed great for the time when considering where technology was at the time, but I’ll always wonder just how useful any of the web features were on that original model. I do remember that as a young kid when the first model came out that I was just amazed for something like it to exist. I was 13 when it was announced so it was just mind blowing. But I didn’t end up using an iPhone until I bought an iPhone 4 from somebody in 2011 when they had just bought a 4s. For a lot of years I’ve usually switched between iPhone and android. It’s kinda ironic in a way that for a phone that was so revolutionary at the start that in later years it really has never made more jumps like that. It’s still a great phone, which I use currently, but it is kinda ironic how the company that was so far ahead at the beginning has now generally been a few steps behind about technology and features released in their new devices each year., Or other things like true GPS navigation on the device. Motorola droid had it in 2009. I don’t think apple got it until 2012."
"I didn&#39;t know apple made this whole screen touch thing possible, @P Harger we are taking about the multitouch and its georgeus design., @P Harger multi touch on a phone is what they invented though not touch screen itself, @P Harger ok i get it, Touch screens were invented in the 1950&#39;s, consumer products appeared in the 1980&#39;s, and went broad scope in the 90&#39;s...  Apple really had nothing to do with the invention and development of touch screens..., Sort of. It was a separate company called Finger Works that came up with the touch screen gesture technology itself. Apple bought them and advanced the existing work."
"Never owned an Apple, yet I&#39;ve ended up with an iPhone 4 &amp; now an iPhone 11 all in mint condition, probably stolen, that I can&#39;t return because of the PIN#.  Impressive, NOT."
Bill Burr
"Absurd to think that the printing press or the internal combustion engine weren&#39;t the most influential products of all time, but good vid"
"One of my favorite youtube channels. &quot;The iPhone is the most influential product of all time,&quot; Dagogo states at the beginning. Well, certainly ONE OF the most influential end products. The Integrated Circuit (IC chip), is perhaps the most influential product ever, but that is a component, not an end product. Fascinating how the iPhone slowly emerged from a lot of different ideas and technologies. Smart phones have have definitely changed humanity, there&#39;s no doubt about that."
"Fun fact:<br>As awesome as the smart phone is, it is like a calculator. It’s only as smart as the user and heavily under utilized. You could learn to become a millionaire on it but most people use it to watch a meme."
"That commencement speech was so real <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24O00Jz8R04&amp;t=8m03s"">8:03</a> Its rare someone speaks with such intelligence anymore"
Apple is selling out the Chinese people. Right now especially.
I can&#39;t help but think about how hard it is to truly design something new and great.  Right now their are a lot of newspaper articles about Elon musk and how horrible he is trying to turn Twitter around. But what they all fail to realize is that Twitter is not profitable and they are all going to have to work hard if it is to become successful. So odd how he is hated by some in the media all of a sudden.
"So current apple has been eating off what Steve left for the company, and no more innovation but growing share prices."
"Great video but doesn&#39;t mention anything about the smartphones before iPhone. Yes, there was already a smartphone market. In 2005 I was connected to the Internet with my iBook while travelling by train by making a bluetooth hotspot with my SonyEricsson P800 connected to Internet via GPRS(56k). Smartphones weren&#39;t as good as iPhone but they were great for back then and I was amazed how people couldn&#39;t see that and still used flippy dumb phones."
"Thank you Ken.  It&#39;s terrible that Steve Jobs wouldn&#39;t give any individuals credit for the amazing things they accomplished to make him look good on stage and take all the credit.  Thank you Degogo for validating what I thought and what usually happens in corporations.  I wish the general public would wake up to this fact that it&#39;s intentionally faceless and nameless engineers and others who create these products and have their health and sometimes their lives destroyed for one man&#39;s vision and for that man to take all the credit and give nothing to the people that made them who they are except maybe a pink slip. Steve Jobs has never been a hero of mine.  He&#39;s the opposite.  Without him we wouldn&#39;t have the iPhone, but we&#39;d have something almost identical in almost the same timeline.  So, is all this suffering really worth it?  I would argue no."
"Bill Burr was right, Jobs was an ahole and had no respect for his employees."
Oh shit!  Bill Burr was right!
I don&#39;t really care that Steve jobs got cancer
"there were a lot of divorces, could those people nit just leave?"
These videos are amazing! I have been watching them back to back. Love your work! Thank you
Steve jobs was just an absolute asshole. Don&#39;t know why he&#39;s glorified as a revolutionary inventor
Steve Jobs was a phony with a bad temper
Touch screens still are greatly flawed
"The SAD part is that these great minds that built apple into what it is probably got no more than their salaries or few stocks options, none compared to the massive riches of Steve J. This is unfortunately the downside of capitalism exploitation  that while your job, family, stability is on the line if you don&#39;t deliver  hat brilliant product but the rewards are miniscule to you and but explosive to the management &amp; &quot;investors&quot;. Its a shame ! Brilliant minds or even regular employees for the companies should be equal partners in the success and benefit from success. !"
"iPhone was soo technologically advanced it&#39;s insane, imagine if we didn&#39;t have the iPhone at that time what the smartphone industry would be looking like rn, posting this comment in 2022 and watching the 1st iPhone it&#39;s amazing how much technology has advanced from the 1st iPhone time, kudos to all the people who worked on the 1st iPhone it was a technological marvel for sure"
Big small big small get on it
"Wow, what a huge miss on your part.  The smart phone and its interface was devised by Marc Porat (starting in 1989) and the team with General Magic, an offshoot of Apple, back in the early 1990&#39;s.  They had essentially laid out the design and approach of the device.  Since the wireless infrastructure at the time was so small, launching that product would have been difficult.  The company dissolved, Apple instead invested in the Newton, and the iPhone was a resurrection of that device when wireless systems could support it.<br><br>The iPhone wasn&#39;t anything substantially different than the visions of Porat and the General Magic team."
"Jobs had some good ideas, was a great marketer and a terrible, cruel, human being., and he paid for it eventually as we know !"
Sounds like another day in the US Army.  Look up the divorce rate among military families. You don’t know what stress and hard work are.
All those who sacrificed to create the iPhone should sue Apple for reparations.
Thank you Mr. Jobs 🙏🏼 rest in peace brother 🕊️
"13.7 billion years ago when the universe was infinitely small, infinitely dense and infinitely hot, it could no longer resist that infinite pressure and spit out the apple.  This is how the apple was invented and the universe followed."

Thank you Ken. Your superhuman
"I’m not so sure if smartphones really made the world better a place.  Because of smartphones &amp; technology, we became more impatient, worked more, became busier, more isolated, obsessed more with how we looked &amp; what we have, pretended on social media, became more anxious &amp; depressed, have more opinions &amp; caused more hate &amp; divide, exploited kids &amp; people in third world countries to mine raw materials for the lithium batteries &amp; list goes on. We don’t know who we are anymore.<br>So not sure if Steve Jobs did the right thing, besides breaking people’s lives through innovation. Since he had a few months to live, he could have chosen to help abused children so they’ll have a better chance in life. <br>When he met God, God would ask him, “So what did you do?”. Jobs would proudly say, “I invented the iPhone.”, smartphones will be the ruin of us all... Steve Jobs was a sociopath.  When he met God, God swiped down"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24O00Jz8R04&amp;t=17m30s"">17:30</a> That three year old is twenty now. Hard to imagine."
"They say Karma is unforgiving it comes back to bite you. Hate to state it this way, did Steve Jobs paid with his short life as a price of  those broken families"
"It&#39;s nice to see the actual people truly behind the creation of the iPhone. While Steve Jobs was a brilliant sales person and visionary when it came to seeing a things potential and future, the hard truth is that when it came to the actual act of creating/coding/building of a device he had no expertise or experience. He just took what others like Steve Woz created and ran with it, taking all the credit. It&#39;s really sad that someone with his vision, intelligence, and sales abilities felt the need to build himself up on the backs of others that really did all the heavy lifting. :("
Bill Burr was on point
This is so informative.<br>So much sacrifices.<br>Pray it&#39;s better for all and all concerned.<br>God bless y&#39;all and your families.<br>Thanks ColdFusion. 🙏
without Wayn will never be   .
Jobs mind set was genius but as a person was an a......  Many genius ppl worked for him and he never appreciated .
Thanks to all your effort love you all.
"Probably the most informative video I&#39;ve ever watched. Loads of things that you just can&#39;t imagine if you aren&#39;t being told. With no exception Coldfusion&#39;s videos are nothing short of unprecedentedly griping and accurately documented, that is an understatement. But this one definitely goes above them all, if only because, for once, it&#39;s not dealing with frauds and fraudsters but right the opposite, dreams come true and dreamers. Its main lesson, imo, is that the path from dream to palpable reality takes way more than what we call the &quot;extra mile&quot;. Call it sacrifice, plain English."
Ironic that millions of people today are reading stuff on a toilet on their iphone.
Everything about the I-phone was invented by the and for military applications. Steve Jobs didn&#39;t invent anything he just cleverly marketed what others in military IT had invented and since government innovation is never patented it is free for anyone to use.
Google pretty much copied Apple. Apple did all the hard work and suffered the consequences. And so my wallet tells google to get f*cked 😜
"I must admit I do love my iPhone, but my favourite is my iPad. My first Apple product was my iPod. Basically I love them all. Sorry to hear about the personal difficulties to the employees. Hope this can be a lesson to future employers not to abuse employees."
So Steve had zero ideas. Just had smart people bring him ideas.
Good story.

Why most richest people comment suicide if the money makes them happy? <br>Well the answer is very clear from your Lord in Holy Quran :<br>&quot;But whoever turns away from My Reminder will certainly have a miserable life,1 then We will raise them up blind on the Day of Judgment. They will cry, “My Lord! Why have you raised me up blind, although I used to see?. Allah will respond, “It is so, just as Our revelations came to you and you neglected them, so Today you are neglected. This is how We reward whoever transgresses and does not believe in the revelations of their Lord. And the punishment of the Hereafter is far more severe and more lasting&#39;&#39;.<br>(20:124 Holy Quran"

"The little guys, the ones that did almost all the work, never get the credit... And that move not inviting the multi-touch, and taking credit for his work, was ice cold, typical sociopathic Jobs move."

Not surprising that Steve Jobs t<br>Is a grade A douche.
"As much as we respect Steve Jobs, I think its time that we acknowledge and accept that he was kind of a dick. He didn&#39;t even respect his own employees who basically sacrificed their own lives for their employer, and then took ALL the credit for the iPhone himself."

"I hate the smart phone -- it has so distracted people from the real world. I have witnessed more traffic fatalities due to phone distraction, unnecessarily long delays at traffic lights because people were so busy texting, etc. My great uncle, 117 years old and the sharpest, most active person ever met, was run over by a guy jumping a curb as he was on his daily 5 mile walk because the guy was too busy responding to a text. My nieces text each other while walking side-by-side, constantly think they hear phantom chirps from silent phones, and turn into nervous wrecks if I get a message and do not check it IMMEDIATELY (&quot;I&#39;ll read it after we get home.&quot;). These distractions retard our ability to concentrate and create and think for ourselves. It is creating a world of sheep who follow instructions because that is the fastest way to get back to their devices. What happened to our ability to remember the things we think and memorize details of things we see? And what is this obsession with getting online phone-fame? Trust me -- glorious anonymity will make you far happier than anyone can dare imagine."

Non-Disclosure agreements can go on well past employment."
Lol you just love to suck Steve’s wiener at the end ay
"I remember in 2008 when I was starting high school, one of my friends had the first iPhone.  When I saw it for the first time it blew me away,  it was the first smart phone I have ever seen, I always thought it was so advance, so ahead of its time.  I didn’t get an smart phone until 2011 the HTC EVO and an iPhone until the 4s.  But damn that technology back then was out of this world.  I will always respect those apple engineers for developing that, they put in the hard work and the hours, but like always the CEO gets the praise., I’m pretty sure everyone got their mind blown seeing the iPhone in person for the first time, The CEO gets the praise for organizing the enterprise, the engineers and the customers, @Aaron Brothers I know the feel. I hired an expensive 10/10 hooker for my high school prom. Everyone was stunned and I was super popular., My brother got it on launch. It was a big deal. Everyone wanted to see it, I wanted iphone in 2008, but no money.... I got my first smart phone in 2016. I was blown away lol."
Watched to the end and on an iPhone. There are great business tips buried in videos like this.

God damn! Bill Burr was right!
"iPhone 14 launched today and it’s crazy how we take for granted the amount of technology in our pockets. Also, look at how far we have gotten in 15 years only."
"Thank you Ken, and all the others who sacrificed to make the iPhone, and thank you Steve."
What type of trance do you play in the background?
"You will never change the trajectory of our existence without first finding those willing to sacrifice everything in the process!!!  <br>In short..  you cant make an omelette without cracking some eggs!<br><br>Also...  86% of us are watching this... Commenting on this,  etc. etc. etc., are doing so on....  Yep...   An iPhone!!"
"Thank you for this video Dagogo &amp; Cold Fusion team, very insightful.  <br>The history is fascinating.  🧐 All those who were involved in this magnificent project of the iPhone thanks for your untold dedication &amp; sacrifices."
"I mean when will they just admit that aliens helped them build this shit?  No way any human came up with any of this stuff. We don’t have the intelligence or the technology. Without our little green friends, we’d still be hunting with sticks and living in mud huts. Of course, we’d be free and not be food for these demons."
"It seems the crushing timelines were probably just selfishness of Jobs, knowing his days were probably numbered and wanting to be around to see it launch."
So I&#39;m not a Apple fan  I don&#39;t use iPhone or macs anymore  but you have to acknowledge the iPhone changed the world  the world changing  innovation Apple gave the world  under Jobbs  but my prsidr to all the Devd that made it happen is in our everyday life everywhere. Let&#39;s see what the M chips will do
I wonder what were all the names might the employee has used on steve to curse
"In this video they talk about someone creating the next big thing in phones. I recently was doing some thinking of creating my own mobile phone and creating my very own font. My phone must be inspired by two words and those two words are &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;perfect.&quot; I mean really, to be normal is what everyone wants and even mentally, and to be perfect or that in which everything is just right then I mean how awesome will that be? And so normal with a little bit of perfection is like perfection ×2.  So therefore those are the two words that my phone will be inspired by."
"Fun Fact: Steve Jobs is in hell for giving technology to normies and a massive platform for the mentally ill to force their ideologies into the political sphere..., I would argue he is in purgatory watching what he built be torn down resulting in much further distress and misery"
"Minute 31 of the video you mention no one really knows who invented these technologies, This is a question, a family member of George W.Bush mentioned in a talk at school that the technology was made first to control the nuclar bomb, if it ever had the need to be used. is this true? and if- what was exactly copied?"
Tim Cook was also below Tony Fideli ;)
The greatest BALL &amp; CHAIN ⛓️ in human history... Who knew they would be collecting your data &amp; using it to control every aspect of your life
"It&#39;s ironic that a device which is - a tool- yes, just a tool - for connection, a device that let&#39;s you talk to your partner, text your best friend, take pictures of your children had to be made on the back of divorces, loss of health and time away from all the things it&#39;s makers loved. Ultimately, while it was a triumph of design, it was a failure of management - of setting unrealistic timelines and unrealistic expectations of employees - for what? Stock price? The history books calling you an innovator? The value of videos like this is not just to talk about the innovation but to talk of the cost people had to unnecessarily endure to get it there - and how we can do better in future"
What people think and will be that steve jobs has built the iphone. But he is just an integral part of it like many others who had given so much of their life to have this amazing device (which is not these days). They all are the unsung heroes of this revolutionary product and needs to be known like steve jobs.. thank you! For the untold story.. 🙏

"Take a WalkMan. Replace the CD player with one of Sharp&#39;s new 1&quot; disk drives and you have the iPod. Take a cell phone and add a good touch screen and you have an iPhone. Take embedded Ubuntu Linux (Linux) and add a facade and you have iOS. Take a cell phone, slightly improve the core, step-and-repeat it more times and you have the M1 (Apple Silicon). The most innovative thing I have seen is sticking an “i” in front of the name.<br><br>I believe Steve Jobs is best exemplified by what he told his partner regarding the earnings for the Breakout video game. Atari paid $7000. Jobs told Wozniak that they had only received $700 and gave him $350."
I had forgotten how crappy the first iphone was
"Apple invented this, iPod ( mp3) Small Computer (iPhone) in Touch technology  at world first. Before that, no one knew what is touch phone. No one knew how to play music without CD/Cassatte. <br>Now today all companies are copying Apple Technology and they killing Apple company.<br>I think Apple company should add some feathers in iPhone, no one can share file easily like Android.  Need to update iOS function to make easy like Android.<br>Best wishes to Apple ❤️<br>Love iPhone from ever.."
"Ken Thankyou to you and everyone else! When the iPhone first came to Verizon for the launch of 4G and a white, double glass iPhone, I could not wait. That was my first iPhone and I’ve had one since. I couldn’t imagine ever owning anything else"
What I don’t get is why there was such a time crunch. Why not just… release it a year later
"What&#39;s hilarious about Steve Jobs saying that multitouch interaction would be &quot;only good for reading something on a toilet,&quot; is that he accurately predicted how we spend 90% of our time on our iPhones 😂"
I&#39;m also very interested in how they marketed such an innovative product.
Lol. I don&#39;t know why I want to cry as I watch the demo presentation.  😭
